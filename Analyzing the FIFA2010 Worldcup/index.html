<h1>Analyzing the FIFA2010 worldcup with Guardian Data and YQL</h1>
<p>The Guardian once again involved in committing a data awesome! As before, the UK newspaper graced developers with a really cool piece of information published on the web: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/jul/09/world-cup-2010-statistics">all the World cup 2010 statistics as an Excel Sheet</a></p>
<p>Now, the easiest way the play with this data is to use YQL, so I simply took a copy of the information and shared it as a CSV document on Google Docs. That way I can use it in YQL:</p>
<div class="code">
<div><strong>Code</strong></div>
select * from csv where url="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AhphLklK1Ve4dEdrWC1YcjVKN0ZRbTlHQUhaWXBKdGc&single=true&gid=1&x=1&output=csv" and columns="surname,team,position,time,shots,passes,tackles,saves"
</div>
<div>You can <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20csv%20where%20url%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Fpub%3Fkey%3D0AhphLklK1Ve4dEdrWC1YcjVKN0ZRbTlHQUhaWXBKdGc%26single%3Dtrue%26gid%3D1%26x%3D1%26output%3Dcsv%22%20and%20columns%3D%22surname%2Cteam%2Cposition%2Ctime%2Cshots%2Cpasses%2Ctackles%2Csaves%22">Try this out in the console</a> and <a href="http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20csv%20where%20url%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Fpub%3Fkey%3D0AhphLklK1Ve4dEdrWC1YcjVKN0ZRbTlHQUhaWXBKdGc%26single%3Dtrue%26gid%3D1%26x%3D1%26output%3Dcsv%22%20and%20columns%3D%22surname%2Cteam%2Cposition%2Ctime%2Cshots%2Cpasses%2Ctackles%2Csaves%22&diagnostics=true">see the results here</a></div>
<p>Using YQL to filter and sort this, you can do some interesting searches on that information. For example:</p>
<h2>What were the German midfield Players?</h2>
<div class="code">
<div><strong>Code</strong></div>
select * from csv where url="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?
key=0AhphLklK1Ve4dEdrWC1YcjVKN0ZRbTlHQUhaWXBKdGc&single=true&gid=1&x=1&
output=csv" and columns="surname,team,position,time,shots,passes,tackles,saves"
and team="Germany" and position="Midfielder"
</div>
<div>You can <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20csv%20where%20url%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Fpub%3Fkey%3D0AhphLklK1Ve4dEdrWC1YcjVKN0ZRbTlHQUhaWXBKdGc%26single%3Dtrue%26gid%3D1%26x%3D1%26output%3Dcsv%22%20and%20columns%3D%22surname%2Cteam%2Cposition%2Ctime%2Cshots%2Cpasses%2Ctackles%2Csaves%22%20and%20team%3D%22Germany%22%20and%20position%3D%22Midfielder%22">Try this out in the console</a> and <a href="http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20csv%20where%20url%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fspreadsheets.google.com%2Fpub%3Fkey%3D0AhphLklK1Ve4dEdrWC1YcjVKN0ZRbTlHQUhaWXBKdGc%26single%3Dtrue%26gid%3D1%26x%3D1%26output%3Dcsv%22%20and%20columns%3D%22surname%2Cteam%2Cposition%2Ctime%2Cshots%2Cpasses%2Ctackles%2Csaves%22%20and%20team%3D%22Germany%22%20and%20position%3D%22Midfielder%22&diagnostics=true">see the results here</a></div>

<p>Using sort() and reverse() you can do rankings. For example:</p>
<h2>Who was the goalkeeper with the most saves?</h2>
<div class="code">
<div><strong>Code</strong></div>
select * from csv where url="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?

and position="Goalkeeper" | sort(field="saves") | reverse()

<p>Using the CSV output and YQL you can do all kind of cool things with that data - as YQL also releases it as JSON it makes it easy to create interactive interfaces and visualizations, too - why don't you have a go?</p>
